### Hi!

Mechanical Engineer and student in Software Engineering. I currently work for a material handling equipment manufacturer developing internal applications that interface with the ERP system and generally try to make people's jobs easier.

Outside of work and school, I have started development on a personal blog platform which I will make public when it's ready. It's more for me to practice writing code (as if I didn't do enough of that), learn Blazor, and end up with a product for me to share my thoughts and publicly show off my triumphs, failures, and lessons-learned in work, school, and life.

Other computer related hobbies include retrocomputing and writing assembly. I own an original hardware Commodore 64 and a Macintosh LC. I'm looking to grow my collection of old hardware and write software to run on them, just for fun.

Besides computers, I enjoy being outside, personal fitness, reading, and spending time with my dog, Apollo.
